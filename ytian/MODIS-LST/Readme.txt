 MOD11C3.005: Aqua flying over CONUS at 1:30 and 13:30, which are 7:30 and 19:30 UTC (at 90W). 
So it is fair to compare ERA-interim at 18Z with Aqua daytime pass.

Two EOS satellites, Terra and Aqua, both carrying the MODIS sensor, are in sun-synchronous orbits. The Terra overpass time is around 1030 local solar time at the equator in its descending (daytime) mode and 2230 local solar time in its ascending (nighttime) mode. The Aqua overpass time is around 1330 local solar time at the equator in ascending (daytime) mode and 0130 local solar time in descending (nighttime) mode.
